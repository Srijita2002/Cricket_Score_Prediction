# Cricket_Score_Prediction

## Introduction

This project aims to predict cricket scores for Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using machine learning techniques. This is based on the Random Forest Regressor algorithm. The model is built on historical IPL match data and is designed to forecast the score of a team given the current match scenario. The project has been deployed as a web application, allowing users to input match details and receive real-time score predictions.

## Features

Historical IPL Data Utilization: Uses extensive historical IPL match data to train the predictive model.

Real-Time Predictions: Provides instant score predictions based on user-inputted match details.

User-Friendly Interface: Deployed as an easy-to-use web application for convenient access and interaction.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses raw IPL data to ensure high-quality inputs for the model.

Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features from the data, such as player statistics, match location, and team performance metrics.

Model Training and Evaluation: Implements robust machine learning algorithms to train and evaluate the predictive model, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

Configurable Parameters: Allows users to adjust various parameters for customized predictions and analysis.
